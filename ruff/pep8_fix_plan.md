# PEP 8 Compliance Plan

## Strategy for Implementing PEP 8 Compliance

Based on the analysis of PEP 8 issues in the codebase, here's a strategic plan to fix them:

### Phase 1: Preparation and Setup

1. **Add Development Dependencies**:
   - Add `autopep8`, `black`, `flake8`, and `isort` to development dependencies
   - Create a standardized configuration for these tools

2. **Create Configuration Files**:
   ```bash
   # Create setup.cfg file for autopep8/flake8 configuration
   echo "[flake8]
   max-line-length = 100
   ignore = E203, W503
   exclude = .git,__pycache__,build,dist,venv

   [isort]
   profile = black
   line_length = 100" > setup.cfg

   # Create pyproject.toml for black configuration
   echo '[tool.black]
   line-length = 100
   target-version = ["py38"]
   include = "\\.pyi?$"
   exclude = "/(\\.git|\\.hg|\\.mypy_cache|\\.tox|_build|buck-out|build|dist)/"' > pyproject.toml
   ```

3. **Set Up Pre-commit Hooks**:
   - Install pre-commit: `pip install pre-commit`
   - Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file

### Phase 2: Initial Bulk Fixes

Focus on fixing issues that can be corrected automatically without risk of changing behavior:

1. **Fix Whitespace Issues First**:
   ```bash
   # Fix trailing whitespace and blank lines with whitespace
   find . -name "*.py" -exec sed -i 's/[ \t]*$//' {} \;
   ```

2. **Sort Imports**:
   ```bash
   # Use isort to organize imports
   isort .
   ```

3. **Apply Automatic Formatting**:
   ```bash
   # Use autopep8 for safe fixes
   find . -name "*.py" -exec autopep8 --in-place --select=E101,E121,E122,E123,E124,E125,E126,E127,E128,E129,E201,E202,E203,E211,E221,E222,E223,E224,E225,E226,E227,E228,E231,E241,E242,E251,E252,E271,E272,E273,E274,E275,W291,W293,W391 {} \;
   ```

### Phase 3: Targeted Code Refactoring

For issues that require more careful handling:

1. **Fix Line Length Issues**:
   - Prioritize files with the highest count of E501 issues
   - Manually review and refactor lines exceeding 100 characters
   - Focus on breaking up long expressions, using line continuation and variable assignments

2. **Fix Import Order and Location Issues**:
   - Address E402 issues (imports not at top of file)
   - May require restructuring some code to avoid circular imports

3. **Fix Indentation Issues**:
   - Address E111, E117, E128 issues
   - Correct indentation to follow 4-space convention

### Phase 4: Code Review and Approval

1. **Run Complete Linting Check**:
   ```bash
   # Check if any issues remain
   flake8 .
   ```

2. **Review Changes**:
   - Ensure changes haven't affected functionality
   - Run tests to verify behavior is unchanged

3. **Create Pull Request**:
   - Document changes made
   - Note any areas that required special attention

### Phase 5: Continuous Enforcement

1. **Integrate with CI Pipeline**:
   - Add linting step to CI workflow
   - Configure it to fail if code doesn't meet PEP 8 standards

2. **Developer Education**:
   - Share common issues and solutions
   - Provide guidelines for writing PEP 8 compliant code

3. **Regular Audits**:
   - Schedule periodic checks to ensure standards are maintained

## Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 1 day - Setup tools and configurations
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 days - Apply automatic fixes
- **Phase 3**: 1-2 weeks - Address complex issues requiring manual intervention
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 days - Review and approval
- **Phase 5**: Ongoing - Maintenance and enforcement

## Special Considerations

1. **High-Risk Files**:
   - Identify critical code paths that need extra testing after formatting
   - Consider breaking changes into smaller, focused PRs for these areas

2. **Custom Rules**:
   - Decide if any PEP 8 rules should be exempted for specific reasons
   - Document and configure tools accordingly

3. **Legacy Code**:
   - Consider more gradual approach for very old or complex modules
   - Focus first on new and actively changed code

This plan provides a structured approach to addressing PEP 8 compliance issues while minimizing the risk of introducing bugs through formatting changes.
