# PyFlakes Issues Summary

## Overview

PyFlakes analysis has identified 124 issues across the codebase. These issues can be categorized as follows:

| Issue Type | Count | Impact |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Unused imports | 78 | Low (code bloat) |
| Unused local variables | 30 | Low-Medium (potential logic errors) |
| Redefinition of unused variables | 8 | Low (confusion/maintenance) |
| F-strings missing placeholders | 7 | Low (inefficient string formatting) |
| Undefined names | 1 | High (certain runtime error) |

## Key Findings

### 1. Unused Imports (78 issues)

Many modules import libraries that are never used. This is especially common with:

- `importlib` imported in many modules but rarely used
- Machine learning and statistical libraries in `time_series_mcp`
- Various TypeScript/Python typing imports

**Example:**
```python
# in nextgen_models/base_mcp_agent.py
import asyncio  # Not used anywhere in the file
import importlib  # Not used anywhere in the file
```

### 2. Unused Local Variables (30 issues)

Variables are declared but never referenced later in the code. This could indicate:
- Incomplete implementation
- Logic errors where values are computed but not used
- Old code that has been partially refactored

**Example:**
```python
# in mcp_tools/time_series_mcp/time_series_mcp.py
local variable 'high' is assigned but never used
local variable 'low' is assigned but never used 
local variable 'volume' is assigned but never used
```

### 3. Redefinition of Unused Variables (8 issues)

Variables are imported or declared multiple times without being used. This is often seen with:
- Repeated imports in different contexts
- Try/except blocks that redefine objects

**Example:**
```python
# in mcp_tools/time_series_mcp/time_series_mcp.py
redefinition of unused 'MMDDrift' from line 203
```

### 4. F-strings Missing Placeholders (7 issues)

F-strings are created with the `f` prefix but don't actually use any variables, making the `f` prefix unnecessary.

**Example:**
```python
# in mcp_tools/test_mcp_tools.py
f-string is missing placeholders
```

### 5. Undefined Names (1 issue)

One serious issue was found that would cause a runtime error:

**In nextgen_models/nextgen_decision/decision_model.py:351**:
```python
undefined name 'updated_weights'
```
This will cause a NameError when the code executes.

## Modules with Most Issues

1. **mcp_tools/time_series_mcp/time_series_mcp.py**: 22 issues
   - Primarily unused imports and unused variables
   - Multiple redefinitions of imported libraries

2. **mcp_tools/test_nextgen_models.py**: 11 issues
   - Several unused imports of model classes
   - Missing f-string placeholders

3. **mcp_tools/risk_analysis_mcp/risk_analysis_mcp.py**: 9 issues
   - Various unused statistical libraries
   - Unused local variables that may affect risk calculations

## Recommendations

1. **Clean up unused imports**:
   - Remove unused imports to improve code readability
   - Consider using tools like `autoflake` to automate this process

2. **Review unused variables**:
   - Check if these variables should be used in calculations
   - Remove variables that are truly not needed

3. **Fix the undefined name issue immediately**:
   - This will cause a runtime error and should be addressed

4. **Standardize import practices**:
   - Conditionally import libraries only when needed
   - Use a consistent pattern for optional imports

5. **Automate PyFlakes checks**:
   - Add PyFlakes to pre-commit hooks or CI pipeline
   - Run regular PyFlakes scans to prevent new issues

## Automated Cleanup Commands

```bash
# Install autoflake for removing unused imports
pip install autoflake

# Remove unused imports
autoflake --in-place --remove-all-unused-imports --recursive .

# Remove unused variables (be careful, review changes first)
autoflake --in-place --remove-unused-variables --recursive .
```

Note: Always run tests after automated changes to ensure no functionality is affected.
