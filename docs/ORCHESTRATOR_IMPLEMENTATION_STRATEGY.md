# Orchestrator vs. Model Files: Implementation Strategy

## 1. Where to Start: Orchestrator or Model Files?

### Recommended Approach

**Start with the Orchestrator File.**

#### Rationale:
- The orchestrator defines the system’s workflow, event handling, and integration points.
- Establishing the orchestrator’s interface and event schema allows model modules to be developed independently and plugged in later.
- The orchestrator can be scaffolded with mock calls to model modules, enabling incremental development and testing.
- This approach encourages modularity and clear separation of concerns.

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Define the Orchestrator Class**: Set up the main event loop, state management, and communication interfaces.
2. **Stub Model Interfaces**: Create placeholder functions/classes for model modules (NLP, forecasting, RAG, etc.).
3. **Develop Model Modules**: Implement each model’s logic, ensuring they conform to the orchestrator’s interface.
4. **Integrate and Test**: Connect model modules to the orchestrator and test end-to-end workflows.

### Alternative Approach

- If you have a specific model or analysis technique ready, you can prototype it independently, but integration will be smoother if the orchestrator’s contract is defined first.

## 2. Has This Been Done Before? Are There Similar Models?

### LLM-Driven Orchestration in Trading and Complex Systems

- **Novelty**: Using an LLM as the central orchestrator for a fully automated trading system is a cutting-edge concept. Most current LLM applications in finance focus on analysis (NLP, sentiment, forecasting), not system-level orchestration.
- **Related Work**:
    - **FinGPT**: The AI4Finance Foundation’s FinGPT project is pioneering LLMs for financial analysis, but their orchestrator is not fully LLM-driven.
    - **AutoGen (Microsoft Research)**: Uses LLMs as agents to orchestrate multi-step workflows, including tool use and decision-making. See: https://github.com/microsoft/AutoGen
    - **LangChain Agents**: LLMs orchestrate tool use and workflow in general AI applications, but not specifically for trading.
    - **OpenAI Function Calling**: LLMs can orchestrate API/tool calls, but production trading orchestration is rare.
    - **Academic Research**: Some papers explore LLMs as “reasoning engines” for multi-agent systems, but production-grade LLM-orchestrated trading is largely unexplored.

### Summary

- **Your approach is at the frontier of current research and development.**
- There are frameworks for LLM-driven orchestration in other domains (AutoGen, LangChain), but few, if any, production trading systems use an LLM as the central orchestrator.
- This project could serve as a reference implementation for the field.

## 4. Recommendations

- **Begin with the orchestrator file** to define system architecture and integration points.
- Use stubs/mocks for model modules to enable parallel development.
- Draw inspiration from agent-based LLM frameworks for orchestration logic.
