# Review of Current Files and Documents

## 1. Project Structure Overview

The project is organized as a comprehensive, modular AI-powered trading system built on the FinGPT framework. The directory structure is well-defined and includes:

- **Core modules** (fingpt/): Orchestrator, selection, forecasting, NLP, RAG, execution, order management, benchmarking, LoRA adaptation.
- **Data connectors** (data/): Polygon, Yahoo Finance, Reddit, Unusual Whales, data preprocessing.
- **Trading integration** (alpaca/): Alpaca API client.
- **Infrastructure**: Redis, InfluxDB, Loki, Prometheus.
- **Documentation** (docs/): System architecture, flow, hardware, and customization plan.
- **Configuration**: .env, requirements.txt, systemd, etc.

## 2. Implementation Status

- **Python source files in core modules and data connectors are currently empty.**
    - Examples: `fingpt/fingpt_bench/bench_model.py`, `fingpt/fingpt_orchestrator/orchestrator_model.py`, `fingpt/fingpt_execution/execution_model.py`, `data/data_preprocessor.py` are all empty.
    - This pattern suggests the codebase is a scaffold/template, ready for implementation but containing no functional code at this time.

## 3. Documentation

- **README.md**: Provides a thorough overview of the systemâ€™s goals, architecture, components, and setup instructions.
- **docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md**: Details the intended modular architecture, component responsibilities, data sources, and integration points.
- **docs/SYSTEM_FLOW.md**: (Not yet reviewed, but referenced as containing data flow and interaction diagrams.)
- **docs/SYSTEM_HARDWARE.md**: (Not yet reviewed, but likely contains hardware requirements.)
- **docs/PLAN_CUSTOMIZE_FINGPT.md**: A detailed plan for customizing/extending FinGPT, including extension points, scenarios, and a Mermaid diagram.

## 4. Configuration and Infrastructure

- **.env.example**: Template for environment variables.
- **requirements.txt**: Placeholder for Python dependencies.
- **systemd/**: Deployment configuration (details not reviewed).

## 5. Summary

- The project is well-documented and architecturally planned.
- The codebase is currently a scaffold with empty implementation files.
- All major components are outlined and ready for development.
- Documentation provides clear guidance for future implementation and customization.

## Recommendations

- Begin implementing core modules as described in the documentation.
- Use the provided customization plan to guide development and extension.
- Regularly update documentation as implementation progresses.
